# Bitcoin-Core PR Review on #31656

## PR Details
- **PR Number**: #[31656](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31656)
- **Title**: test: Add expected result assertions
- **Author**: [yancyribbens](https://github.com/yancyribbens)
- **Date Reviewed**: February 21, 2025

## Overview
Replaces the assertion, where the one that was in place is a check on ANY result, the new one asserts that the result is actually the sollution with the lowest weight. 

## Review Process
- **Codebase Area**: wallet unit test - coinselector_tests
- **Steps Taken**:
  1. Cloned the repo and checked out the PR branch
  2. Built and ran tests locally
  3. Reviewed code changes line-by-line
- **Environment**:
  - OS: nix-shell on mac (linux) 
  - Compiler:  Clang 18.1.8
  - Bitcoin Core Version: [84f359f](84f359ff2fdb71a6f624c73eab45449405be0b45)

## Findings
### Code Quality
- **Readability**: 
The expected result is clearly buildup by adding the needed coins to the expected outcome vector.
- **Conformance**: ++i use in stead of i++; (yes) 
- **Potential Issues**: na

### Functionality
- **Behavior**: Work as intended
- **Testing**:
  - Unit Tests: Pass, no code coverage change
  - Functional Tests: Pass, no code coverage change
  - Manual Testing: Test fails if weight is changes, as expected. 

### Performance
- **Impact**: No noticeable impact
- **Benchmarks**: NA

### Security
NA

## Comments & Suggestions
Only suggestion made was that the test title could use "must find a fitting solution" in stead of "must find a good solution", but it's a small nit. 

## Conclusion
- **Recommendation**: Approve
- **Reason**: 
- **Additional Notes**: 
  - Learned that the preference is to use the ++i convertion instead of i++ (this is also mentioned in the developer-notes)
  - Learned about the workings of the Coingrinder, as per [pr note of murchandamus] (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31656#issuecomment-2637229838)  "The purpose of this set of tests is to demonstrate that CoinGrinder succeeds for a few simple challenges and fails as expected when there is no solution. If you search for e.g., the target amount, you might notice that the first few tests of this set were copied from the SRD tests. In the context of the CoinGrinder pull request, the tests were also used to demonstrate how later optimizations reduce the count of attempts necessary to determine the optimal solution.\
  \
  A falsy "res" indicates that no solution was found. So you are right, this test would accept if CoinGrinder found a solution with 9×2 ₿ and 23–27×0.33 ₿ UTXOs, or 10×2 ₿ and 17–26×0.33 ₿ UTXOs. More than 36 UTXOs would exceed the maximum weight. The test’s title should have been adjusted when the test was reused for CoinGrinder, as the "must find a good solution" refers just to selecting enough funds while staying under the weight limit, but CoinGrinder does even more. Since SRD was improved to drop the smallest value UTXO when its selection is overweight, it will succeed to find a solution, but would likely not find the lowest-weight solution. (Knapsack would likely fail to find a solution, as it doesn’t address excess weight explicitly and its two passes would be conducive to surface the valid selections.BnB would also not find a solution here, because the combinations fall outside of the exact match range.)\
  \
Given two sets of UTXOs that all have the same weight, where the first set has higher value and the second set has lower value, the optimal solution is obviously to take all of the higher value UTXOs and enough of the lower value ones. CoinGrinder is a deterministic algorithm that traverses the UTXOs sorted by descending effective value on the inclusion branch first, i.e., it will first select all the highest value UTXOs until it exceeds the target unless it exceeds the maximum weight. The first selection set that exceeds the target amount will be the optimal solution of 10×2 ₿ + 17×0.33 ₿, which is why CoinGrinder will always produce the expected_result that is being tested here, even before the later optimizations allow it to determine that this solution is the optimal solution.\
\
The number of attempts CoinGrinder takes to determine that this is the optimal solution goes from failing to do so (by needing more than 100,000 attempts) to 184, and then 37."

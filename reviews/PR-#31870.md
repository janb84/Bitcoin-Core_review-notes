# Bitcoin-Core PR Review on #31870

## PR Details
- **PR Number**: #[31870](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/31870)
- **Title**: fuzz: split coinselection harness
- **Author**: [brunoerg](https://github.com/brunoerg)
- **Date Reviewed**: February 25, 2025

## Overview
This PR splits the coinselection fuzz harness into 3 targets: coinselection_bnb, coinselection_knapsack, and coinselection_srd. The Knapsack alg. is a lot slower so separating the different algo's seems like a good suggestion. Also if there is a memory leak, this will give a better indication which of the algo's has issues. 

## Review Process
- **Codebase Area**: wallet fuzzing coinselection
- **Steps Taken**:
  1. Cloned the repo and checked out the PR branch
  2. Built and ran tests locally
  3. Reviewed code changes line-by-line
  4. Compiled CodeCoverage of new Fuzz targets
- **Environment**:
  - OS: nix-shell on mac (linux) 
  - Compiler:  Clang 19.1.7
  - Bitcoin Core Version: [ba82240](ba82240553ddd534287845e10bc76b46b45329fe)

## Findings
### Code Quality
- **Readability**: Improved, 
- **Conformance**: Commit message is sparse, have seen some reviewers comment on that on other PR's no clue if this is needed for a split.
- **Potential Issues**: Not that I see.

### Functionality
- **Behavior**: Works, fuzzing runs 3x
- **Testing**:
  - Unit Tests: NA
  - Functional Tests: NA
  - Fuzz Tests: 3 added 1 removed, works

### Performance
NA

### Security
NA

## Comments & Suggestions
None

## Conclusion
- **Recommendation**: Approve
- **Reason**: Solid implementation
- **Additional Notes**: I tried to get create a Coverage report of the split fuzzing targets, without avail. The fuzzing doc only outlines how to do fuzzing not how generate a coverage. Found some [scripting](https://github.com/maflcko/b-c-cov/blob/ci/.cirrus.yml) on the internet how someone else is doing it in a container. Can get it to run but on the actual coverage it fails to find the cpp files. Needs further investigation. Possible PR if found to extend the fuzzing doc.

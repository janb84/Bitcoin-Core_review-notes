## Comments & Suggestions
As a good practice in bitcoin "don't trust but verify" I have validated the content as provided and described in the PR:
```
# VARINT(Compressed(MAX_MONEY + 1)) + VARINT(0)
b"\xa0\xc8\xad\xb1\xd1\x83\xff\x01" + b"\x00",
```

MAX_MONEY = 21000000 * COIN = (21000000 * 100000000) = 2100000000000000
MAX_MONEY +1 = 2100000000000001

The compressed function refers to the CompressAmount function as defined in bitcoin/src/compressor.cpp \
Compressed(2100000000000001) = 18900000000000001 \
VARINT(18900000000000001) = a0 c8 ad b1 d1 83 ff 01 \

And this corresponds with the value used provided in the test

## Conclusion
- **Recommendation**: Approve
- **Reason**: Improves readability of test, no more magic value 
- **Additional Notes**: -
